# Let's get down to business

### Review
**After yesterday we know how to make a few things**

Let go through them
- Headers
- Writing code
- short code snippets

Today we're doing a few new things
- writing links
- making images
- bullets
  - like this
    - sub bullets
- make _**text**_ **bold** and _italics_
- write code blocks with specific languages
- make tables

# Let's do it!!!!~~~~

## Headers
` # Header looks like this`

## links!
[The link text](http://wikipedia.com)

And by the way this is what all the user interfaces looked like

## bullets
- We did this already above
  - BTW look at the list above
    - and we can keep nesting these bullets

## Bold and italics

**BOLD**

_ITALICS_

## Write code blocks

```c++
int c = 4;
```
```javascript
var x = 7;
```
```markdown
## This is a header
```
```bash
$ git init
```
`# this is a header`
## Table
| This is my first column | My second column |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| fist Item | second Item |

| Header One     | Header Two     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |

` The shortcut is to actually write the word table and hit tab`

# BTdubs You have hw!
### Now it's your turn
Assignment for rest of class and homework
- We're going to be making short profile pages for ourselves.
  - They show up under a file called README.md
  - This file should be created inside of a directory in w03 called homework
  - If you do the work right, When you visit that section of the repository on github, you will end up seeing the profile page you created
