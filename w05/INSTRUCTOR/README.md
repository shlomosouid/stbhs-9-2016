# Today we're working with HTML!!!

HTML Stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language

The code in this file is NOT HTML, but is Markdown.

In markdown we have regular headers.
# Header 1 in Markdown
## Header 2 in Markdown
### Header 3 in Markdown
```HTML
<h1>Header in html</h1>
<h2>Header 2</h2>
<h3>header 3</h3>

```
